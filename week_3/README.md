# Task - Building a Custom Filtering Function in Rust

In this task, you will create a custom filtering function in Rust that allows filtering elements from a given collection based on a specific condition.

## Steps

1. Define a struct called FilterCondition with a single field of the desired type for filtering.
2. Implement a method called is_match on the FilterCondition struct that takes a reference to an item of the same type as the filter condition and returns a boolean indicating whether the item matches the condition.
3. Define a function called custom_filter that takes a collection (e.g., a vector) and a reference to a FilterCondition object as arguments. The function should iterate over the elements in the collection and return a new collection containing only the elements that match the filter condition.
4. In the main function, create a collection (e.g., a vector) with some elements and initialize a FilterCondition object with the desired value.
5. Call the custom_filter function with the collection and the FilterCondition object, storing the result in a new variable.
6. Print the filtered result to the console.
7. Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
